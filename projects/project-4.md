For my ICS 314: Software Engineering I class, I collaborated with three of my classmates, <a href="https://ryan38.github.io/">Ryan Ganiron</a>, <a href="https://joeparagas.github.io/">Joseph Paragas</a>, <a href="https://lcaraang.github.io/">Louella Caraang</a>, in order to build a web application called WarriorJam. The idea is to create an avenue for students, teachers, and/or staff who are musically inclined to collaborate with others who share the same interests.

Other than trying to lead my team sometimes, I also contributed on both the front-end and back-end developments of the application. I mostly worked on the back-end development of the app and trying to work with MongoDB. For the front-end part, most of them are seen in the screenshots down below. For the first three images --  About Page, Profile Page, and Browse Open Mic Events Page -- I did them from scratch. I used Semantic UI + React elements such as Cards, Grid, Header, Containers, Images, and many more. For the last three images -- Create Profile Page, Browse Musicians Page, and Landing Page -- I didn't build the pages, however I helped in the process of doing so and also improving them as much as I can.

In this project, I learned how important time management and communication are. It's also important to step up, especially when everyone seems lost in the process. I don't doubt that our team is filled with good programmers, because all of us did pretty good in class, individually. However, I think the application would have been better if we had good communication and were able to manage our own time efficiently. Overall, I am glad to have this experience and am excited to try it again.
