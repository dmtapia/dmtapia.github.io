<p>&ensp;&ensp;“Digital technology continues to extend into every area of our lives,” Douglas Rushkoff, one of the writers of the documentary Frontline: Digital Nation, states, “yet the people developing these tools seem to be doing so with less regard for how we'll be affected in the future than how we might be influenced in the present” (Goodman). In this point in time, technology is something that cannot be avoided due to the fact that it has already been a part of people’s everyday lives. Indeed, the human race has been getting a lot of benefits from the technological advancements that were made through the years, but the disadvantages that they could bring to everyone are just as evident. Modern technology has been negatively affecting different areas in people’s lives, including their communication skills, their self-identity, and their rights to privacy.</p>

<p>&ensp;&ensp;Digital technology is deteriorating the effectiveness of individuals in communicating physically. For the past few years, developers of technology have paved the way for people to be able to interact without having to be in the same place physically, such as making use of e-mails and social networking sites. And, now that people are living in a fast-paced world, this type of communication is really useful. Similarly, in some cases, online games are also being used as a way of interaction. Francoise LeGouse, former vice president of Innovation Initiatives of International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), has described the 3D internet as “something that is going to change the way people communicate, because it feels real” (Goodman). However, in spite of the fact that mediated communication saves more time and energy, it makes one person susceptible of being deceived by other people. With the opportunity to ‘sugarcoat’ words, how will people be able to surely say that the person they are talking to is in fact stating the truth? In a physical conversation, one is encouraged to say whatever he has in mind with the ability to fully express his emotions, thus, promoting transparency, which is one of the factors that could make a conversation more effective, but something that is not easy to achieve online. Moreover, an effective communicator is more trustworthy if he has the ability to speak in front of another person or a group of people with full confidence, which, once again, is not being practiced on mediated conversations. Furthermore, a person with good communication skills knows how to listen attentively. But, how can someone be that person in this modern world where people seem to have “no time to listen” anymore? (Restak 338) </p>

<p>&ensp;&ensp;Digital technology is making people create multiple identities. Social networking sites are not only being used as a way to communicate to other people. Some people use them purely for the sake of entertainment, but others consider them as a way to show people who they really are. Although the latter can be seen as an advantage, this is also where the problem lies. Richard Restak, a clinical neurology professor at George Washington Hospital University, states that, because of these technological advances, people are trying to live in “many different and disparate ‘realities’” (341). With that being said and with people spending more time browsing through their social media accounts rather than physically staying connected to the world, how are they able to identify their real identity? It is indeed true that the social media allows an individual to be someone he desires to be, yet some people have a tendency to go over the limit. There are people who have been using other people’s information, including names, pictures, and, sometimes, even life events just to gain acceptance and be more interesting from the online crowd’s perspectives. Also, even though there are some who try not to pose as other individuals, they, too, have become reliant on other people’s “likes” and comments to define their self-worth, which should never be the case. Both situations are just showing how people have become more insecure and narcissistic, at the same time, because of social media. And, this is not the only disadvantage of living in a world where social media has become the primary way to connect to other people. As a matter of fact, netizens – people who use internet – are able to voice out their thoughts publicly through the SNS, which could sometimes lead to defamation of other people or even themselves.  </p>

<p>&ensp;&ensp;With these technological advancements, the people’s right to privacy is in jeopardy. Because of today’s innovations, different sectors of the government have been using digital footprints for an easy access on individuals for future use. However, it is not only the government who uses them. The latest iPhones have this new feature wherein a person can use his digital fingerprints to easily access his phone, pay his bills, and buy products. But, who knows where else these digital fingerprints are being used? Other than that, the use of internet has also been putting the rights to privacy of individuals at risk. When one tries to look for his name in existing search engines, such as Google and Yahoo, there are times when he could find pictures or information he has posted on their private pages wandering around the internet. In spite of the fact that the speed of information being passed on from one person to another through the internet is astounding, it is not really a safe place for them. When signing up for any online account, a list of terms and conditions are given by the website owners for people to know what they are putting themselves into. But then again, in this fast-moving world, where people are always too busy, who would even have the time to read these long lists? Even though these individuals are technically at fault, they usually agree to these terms and conditions to be able to instantly connect to other people from around the globe, which is becoming a must in this modern world. And if this is the case, people seem to be left with no choice but to accept the fact that the digital technology is never going to fully commit in considering their rights to privacy.  </p>

<p>&ensp;&ensp;Generally, digital technology helps people go through their everyday lives, and this fact makes it completely unavoidable. However, people should be aware of the long-term effects that it has brought to them and to the world. It has started affecting different areas in their lives – communication, self-identity, rights, education, businesses, and many more. Who knows what else could these advancements do in the future? It is never wrong to be innovative and to develop existing technology to make lives much easier. Nevertheless, the human race should remember that, in this world, they should be the ones controlling technology and not the other way around. (1176)</p>
