<p>There's a saying that professors always say and it goes like this: <i>"there are no stupid questions"</i>, which I do agree with. If you don't know something or don't understand something, ask away. It's better to feed your curiosity thant staying ignorant for the rest of your life. However, from Eric Raymond's essay, How To Ask Questions The Smart Way, I learned that in order to get good answers, you have to ask questions the "smart" way.</p>

<p>For software engineers, StackOverflow has been one of their go-to sites. This is where they usually ask questions in order to find the solution to theri machine-related problems. For example, one of the questions I found is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1335851/what-does-use-strict-do-in-javascript-and-what-is-the-reasoning-behind-it">What does “use strict” do in JavaScript, and what is the reasoning behind it?</a> Now, this is something I am also curious about. When I first encountered "use strict" while trying to study Javascript through FreeCodeCamp, I also wondered what it was for. The person who asked did not just ask that question but also provided some information as to why he wants to know the importance (or lack thereof) of "use strict". He also mentioned that he did some research before hand. Now those are just a few elements of a good question. And, as expected, on this thread, a lot of Javascript users have responded in a systematic matter. Some of them provided sources, while some of them explained through writing codes. However, not all questions or threads are like this.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, some users of StackOverflow just start a thread without doing any research first. Fortunately, concerned users would tag these threads as 'duplicates' and respond with the link of the same question that was already on the site. For example, the thread <a href = "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/523643/difference-between-and-in-javascript">Difference between == and === in JavaScript [duplicate]</a> is a duplicate of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/359494/which-equals-operator-vs-should-be-used-in-javascript-comparisons">Which equals operator (== vs ===) should be used in JavaScript comparisons?</a> Though the questions are fomulated differently, the answers can still be found on the latter thread. And even though I don't think the former question is not a stupid one, it still makes the thread unnecessary. And that is an example of not asking questions effectively.</p>
