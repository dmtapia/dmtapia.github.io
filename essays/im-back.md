<h3>Start of Something New</h3>
<p>As soon as programming was introduced to me in high school, way back in 2011, I fell in love with it right away. As soon as I submitted my first working program to my then instructor, I knew what I was going to do for college. And so, on my second year, I ended up in the Department of Computer Science in the University of the Philippines - Diliman. But, only then I found out, <i>love</i> is not enough to keep anything around.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed programming, because of the process. Whenever my professors gave me a task that involved writing codes, it always felt like I was given a problem and I had to solve them. And once I do, that feeling people feel when they get rid of their real-life problems? I would feel the same way, too. It is actually like solving math problems -- <i>I love math</i>. And I loved programming, because it was the only other thing I was good at... or so I thought.</p>
