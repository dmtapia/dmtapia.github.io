  <p>For nine years, I repeatedly questioned myself if this, being in Computer Science, is what I really wanted -- <i>and yes, nine years</i>. Within those years, I always knew I loved programming, but I was not sure if being in this field was for me. Even last semester, when I was taking a class in Algorithms (for the third time), I was questioning why I was even in this major. There have been multiple instances where I have lost interest in programming and it felt like I was only doing it for the grades and just so I could graduate soon. But this semester, while working on three projects for three diffrent 400+ ICS classes, I was reminded why, even after multiple failed classes, I am still here, wanting to write more codes. </p>

  <p>One of the projects I was working on is called the <a href="https://github.com/hot-n-code/ghg-tracker">GHG Tracker</a>. "GHG Tracker," as described in the Hot N' Code webpage, "is a web application designed to track the carbon footprint that residents of Hawaiâ€™i produce and reduce." It was a project in ICS 414 (Software Engineering II) that our team, <a href="https://hot-n-code.github.io/">Hot N' Code</a>, developed for <a href="http://www.hei.com/">Hawaiian Electric Industries (HEI)</a>. And for me, this project was the main contributor to the rediscovery of my passion in programming. The entire experience reminded me of that same feeling I had when I ran my first coding project 10 years ago, only a little bit better.</p> 
  <p>Working with a client was a whole new experience for me. We were only given a list of what they want the application to do, but the implementation, the user interface, how we were going to do the computations, and the database management were totally up to us. It was definitely like working for a real company as professionals, not just students.</p>
  <p>In this project, I mostly worked on the database and most functionalities that matches the requirements given to us by HEI. I chose to work on the backend, because I knew I was not good with designing web applications. Still, it was definitely a challenge for me considering the last time I worked with Javascript, Meteor, NodeJS and MongoDB was more than a year ago for ICS 314(Software Engineering I). Because of this, I spent most of my time relearning different coding syntaxes and practices. In addition to this, we were also required to do Issue Driven Project Management (IDPM) reviews where we review codes written by our teammates. I actually appreciated the reviews, because it taught me different coding standards and, most importantly, that it is easy to make mistakes (and it is hard to see them) on your own code. I also made sure to implement concepts I was learning in ICS 427 (Software Quality Assurance) and in ICS 464 (Human Computer Interaction I) for the security and the design of our project. Overall, I definitely enjoyed the technical part of this project. Like I told one of my teammates, "<i>[I'm] just learning so much. [It] sounds sappy, but it made me remember why I chose this major.</i>"</p>
  
  <h2>Hot N' Code</h2>
  <img class="ui medium left floated image" src="../images/hot-n-code.png"><p>Another reason I enjoyed working on this project was <i>teamwork</i>. When we were first told about the project, I imagined it was going to be hard, considering we were also supposed to work with peers we barely know. Personally, I did not want to work with random people, because I do not know what their work ethic is like. But then again, it is like this in the real world anyway. Fortunately, I was grouped with people who were just as passionate in Computer Science as I was, if not more, and were willing to go above and beyond for this project. We were not a perfect team, there has definitely been some misunderstandings and miscommunications, and it could get frustrating at times, but most of us were always there to help each other when we encounter different problems. Leading a team was also not one of my strengths, because I know how controlling I can be, but (somewhat-- not officially) leading this team was one of the best experiences I have had as a Computer Science student. I would definitely want to work with them again in the future -- most of us are actually going to join this year's Hawai'i Annual Code Challenge (HACC).</p>
