For nine years, I have repeatedly questioned myself if this, being in Computer Science, is what I really wannted -- <i>and yes, nine years</i>. Within those years, I always knew I loved programming, but I was not sure if being in this field was for me. Even last semester, when I was taking a class in Algorithms (for the third time), I felt like I was too (excuse the language) stupid for Computer Science. There have been multiple instances where I have lost interest in programming and it felt like I was only doing it for the grades and just so I could graduate soon. But this semester, while working on three projects for three diffrent 400+ ICS classes, I was reminded why, even after multiple failed classes, I am still here, wanting to write more codes.
