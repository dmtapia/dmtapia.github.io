<h5>Friendster and Myspace</h5>
<p>Remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendster">Friendster</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace">Myspace</a>? Before <a href="https://facebook.com">Facebook</a> even became a thing, these two social networking sites (SNS) were the most famous ones. I was really young back then and should probably not be on those sites, but... eh. My favorite thing about these SNS is that they allowed us to tweek the themes of our pages, thus, introducing me to CSS and HTML even before I learned them in school. Another one of my favorite sites, <a href="https://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>, allowed me to do the same thing. But, back then, I didn't know about Semantic UI, so tweeking my pages required hours, or sometimes even days.</p>

<h5>Webpage Builders</h5>
<p>My interest in building webpages grew with my age. And, websites like <a href="https://wix.com">Wix</a> and <a href="https://weebly.com">Weebly</a> helped me create them without having to do much with the html and css codes. However, there were times that I wished I created my own webpages, using my own themes. And now that my ICS 314: Software Engineering I class introduced me to Semantic UI, I know I can do that.</p>
