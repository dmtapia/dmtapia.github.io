<p>As soon as programming was introduced to me in high school, way back in 2011, I fell in love with it right away. As soon as I submitted my first working program to my then instructor, I knew what I was going to do for college. And so, on my second year, I ended up in the Department of Computer Science in the University of the Philippines - Diliman. But, only then I found out, <i>love</i> is not enough to keep anything around.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed programming, because of the process. Whenever my professors gave me a task that involved writing codes, it always felt like I was given a problem and I had to solve them. And once I do, that feeling people feel when they get rid of their real-life problems? I would feel the same way, too. I even remember giving myself the "problems" like wondering how elevators work. Do they use conditional statments? How about loops? How does the overload alert work? And I loved programming, because it was one of the only two things I was good at in high school... or so I thought.</p>

<p>I passed my first programming class with ease and that made me want to stay in the computer science program even more. However, my second one? It was not as fun. It was extremely challenging. I failed it twice, got kicked out of the department, applied for reconsideration, and finally, passed the course on my third time taking it. There were times when I thought it just was not for me. Few years later, I would give it up and switch to a different major.</p>

<p>I graduated as a Natural Science - Information and Communications Technology (then Pre-Computer Science) at the Kapiolani Community College in Fall 2017, but I was not happy at all. Suddenly, programming felt boring to me. And, so I took a break and went for something else only to find myself crawling back a year and a half later. I just missed it -- even the sleep deprivation that comes with it. As I write my first practice WOD for ICS 314, I remembered how much I enjoyed programming. </p>

<p>What skills do I want to acquire in the future? I want to be able to build programs efficiently and in a short period of time. I want to be a good enough software engineer to build programs that will help people who are underpriveleged. In one of the projects I talked about on my TechFolio, I mentioned volunteering for an event that my then organization conducted. We taught OpenOffice to public school students, because it is a free and open software. And that is something like that is what I want to be able to offer to kids like them later on.</p>
